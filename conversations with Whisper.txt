Whisper: Alright alright. I guess you DO have a point. I will give you a choice then. I have something I'd like 
for you to do for me. Say yes, and I will free you. Say no, and I leave you here. What do you say, quite the 
shortcut yes?

Willow: What is the request?

Whisper: Ah sorry, but this game works a little diffrent. I will only tell you if you accept.

A. No

Willow: There's no way I can accept a deal like that.

(whisper smiles)
