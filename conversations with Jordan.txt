Willow and Jordan sitting in their pond. (the jordan affinity goes up when you are honest with him.)

Jordan: You've been... strange. Are you sure everything is okay?

A. Tell Him you've been hearing voices. 

Willow: ....... I've been... hearing a..a voice lately. I think I might be going crazy. (+100 JordanA)

(If you kill jordan, but have an affinity with parents over 500, this ending will trigger)

Willow enters the real relm from the underworld. Her house is on fire. She goes to find her parents but they are
asleep and nothing will wake them. She cries as she holds them, and all 3 of them burn.
